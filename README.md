# Omnifocus `.ofocus` file format

This document is written by reverse engineering an Omnifocus 2.3.1 `.ofocus` file and leveraging the awesome work of `tomzx`.

## Overview

The `.ofocus` file is basically a directory with a set of `.zip` files:

### 1. Master file
There is a master file named `00000000000000={uuid}+{randomId}.zip`
TODO: what are the `-write-in-progress` files?

### 2. Transaction files
Each `.zip` file contains a `contents.xml` file, which is a transaction (a set of data) in `XML` format.

named `{date in GMT}={randomID}+{randomID}.zip` which are transactions files that apply over the master file. 
The `randomId` values have the same format as the random ids used within the file (see `id` in the [Formats](#formats) section). 

### 3. Client files
Information about the client files

To build the history, one will start with the master file and read the chain of transactions files, something that will look like the following:

```
00000000000000={uuid}+A.zip (master file)
{date in GMT}={A}+{B}.zip (transaction file 1)
{date in GMT}={B}+{C}.zip (transaction file 2)
{date in GMT}={C}+{D}.zip  (transaction file 3)
...
{date in GMT}={Y}+{Z}.zip  (transaction file n)
```

## File content

### Master file

The content of each `contents.xml` is as follow:

Legend
*Optional*

* omnifocus
	* setting(id : id)
 		* *added(order : unsigned int) : datetime*
		* *modified : datetime*
		* plist(version : string) : string/xml
	* context(id : id)
		* added(order : unsigned int) : datetime
		* *modified : datetime*
		* name : string
		* rank : signed int
		* *context(idref : id)* - reference to parent context
		* *location(name : string, latitude : string, longitude : string)*
	* folder(id : id)
		* *folder(idref : id)* - reference to parent folder
		* added : datetime
		* *modified : datetime*
		* name : string
		* rank : signed int
		* *hidden : bool*
	* task(id : id) - has either a project or task child. A project child declares the project's properties while a task child declares the parent of the current task
		* *project* - declares a project/single-action list
			* folder(idref : id) - reference to parent folder
			* last-review : datetime
			* *next-review : datetime*
			* review-interval : string (interval format)
			* *status : string (active, inactive, done, dropped) (if not specified, active by default)*
			* *singleton : bool (if not specified, false by default)* - indicate if the project is composed of single actions
		* *task(idref : id)* - reference to parent task
		* *inbox* - indicate if this task is part of the inbox
		* *note*
			* *text* (formatted as HTML)
		* added(order : unsigned int) : datetime
		* *modified : datetime*
		* name : string
		* rank : unsigned int (relative to parent task?)
		* *context(idref : id)* - reference to context
		* *due : datetime*
		* *start : datetime*
		* *completed : datetime*
		* *estimated-minutes : unsigned int*
		* *flagged : bool*
		* *order : string (parallel) (if not specified, sequential by default)*
		* *repeat : string (interval format)*
		* *repetition-rule : string (FREQ=MONTHLY, FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=4)*
		* *repetition-method : string (fixed)*
	* perspective(id : string/id) - either a predefined string (ProcessInbox, ProcessProjects, ProcessContexts, ProcessDueSoon, ProcessFlagged, ProcessReview, ProcessCompleted) or an id (see below)
		* plist(version : string) : string/xml

### Transaction xml files

* omnifocus
	* element(op="reference|add|update|delete") (not specifying an op = add)

A `op="reference"` is basically a copy of the referenced data within the transaction (in case something were to happen to the original reference).

Any id referred to in the transaction file will be included as part of the transaction with an `op="reference"` attribute.

### Formats

The `id` used as attribute is 11 characters long, in what appears to be base 64 (`A-Za-z0-9\_\-`).

The `datetime` is formatted according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) with precision to the milliseconds (`2014-11-03T10:14:09.123Z`).

`Interval format` is @periodduration (@1d, @1w, @1m, @1y) 

The `rank` appears to be a global value shared by all data types.
